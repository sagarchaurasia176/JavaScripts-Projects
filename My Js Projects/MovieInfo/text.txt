Movie Database:

- Use an API like The Movie Database (TMDb) to fetch movie data.
Create an array to store movie data (each movie represented as an object with properties 
like title, releaseDate, genre, etc.).

- Use a for loop to fetch movie data for a specific category (e.g., popular movies, 
top-rated movies) and populate the array.

- Implement a while loop to allow the user to interact with the movie database,
 such as searching for movies, filtering by genre, or exiting the application.

- Use the filter function to display movies based on criteria like genre, release year, etc.

- Use map to transform the movie data, such as formatting release dates, displaying only 
specific information, or creating an HTML representation.
